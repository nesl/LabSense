"""
SensorSafe Data Transmitter
Connects socket to tcp://localhost:5556
Collects data from Zwave interface using Zeromq and
   sends the data in JSON to SensorSafe

Usage: python sendToSensorSafe.py [api-key] [Options]"

    [api-key] is the API key given when registering for a SensorSafe account.

    Options:

        -f [frequency]
            This is the number of seconds between each http request
            to SensorSafe."

            If [frequency] is not specified or is set to 0, the requests
                are made every time the data is received by the zeromq socket.

        -e This option specifies that all event-driven measurements should be
           sent right away (usually because they are more time-critical)
           instead of sending based on the frequency. Note that the none
           event-driven measurements will still be governed by the frequency
           and are not affected. Currently, the event-driven measurements
           are Motion and Door Status (Open/Closed).

        -v Verbose option that shows more information about the upload to
           SensorSafe.
